# indentml
## General-purpose indent-based markup language

**indentml** (previously known as *MLQQ*) is a simple general-purpose indent-based markup language designed to represent tree-like structures in human-readable way. It is similar to *YAML* but simpler.

### Install

    pip install indentml
   
Currently only Python 3 supported.

            The standard structure to store elements accessible by arbitrary keys
            (mapping) in Python is called a dict (dictionary) and in JavaScript
            â€” object.

                    You can access elements of an object either with square brackets
                    or with dot-notation.

### Syntax
#### Special characters
The following characters have special meaning in **indetml**:

1. **Tag beginning character.** This character is used to mark the beginning of any tag. By default, it is backslash `\` 
(like in LaTeX), but can be configured to any other character. If you need to enter this character literally, you have 
to escape it with the same character (like `\\`). You can also escape other special characters listed below with *tag beginning character*.
2. Opening and closing brackets: `{`, `}`, and `[`, `]`, used to indicate the content that belongs to *inline tags*, see below.
3. Tabs are forbidden at the beginning of the line in **indentml** (just like in YAML).

#### Block tags
Block tags are typed at the beginning of the line, after several spaces that mark *indent* of a tag.  
Block tag starts with *tag beginning character* and ends with the whitespace or newline character. All the lines below the block tag
which indent is greater than tag's indent are appended to the tag. When indent decreases, tag is closed. E.g.

    \tag
        Hello
        \othertag
            I'm indentml
        How are you?
    I'm fine
    
will be translated into the following XML tree:

    <tag>Hello
    <othertag>I'm indentml
    </othertag>How are you?
    </tag>I'm fine

The rest of a line where block tag begins will be attached to that tag either.

#### Inline tags
Inline tags are started with *tag beginning character* and ended by bracket: `{` or `[`. Type of bracket affects the 
processing. Tag contents is everything between its opening bracket and corresponding closing bracket. 
It can spread over several lines.

Brackets (of the same kind) inside the tag should be either balanced or escaped.

For example,

    This is \tag{with some {brackets} inside}
    
is valid markup: the contents of tag `tag` will be `with some {brackets} inside`.

#### Allowed tags
Only those tags are processed that are explicitly *allowed*. There are two sets defined: allowed block tags and allowed inline tags.
The sequences that look like tags but are not in the appropriate set is considered as simple text.

#### Indents and whitespaces
Indent of the first line after the block tag is a *base indent* of this tag. All lines that belong to tag will be stripped 
from the left by the number of leading whitespaces that corresponds to the base indent. The rest of whitespaces will be preserved.

For example:

    \pythoncode
        for i in range(1, 10):
            print(i)

Here the contents of `pythoncode` tag is 

    for i in range(1, 10):
        print(i)

Note four whitespaces before `print`.

If a line has an indent that is less than *base indent*, it MUST be equal to the indent of one of open block tags. Than 
all the tags up to that one (including that one) will be closed.

For example, the following is forbidden:

    \code
        some string with indent 4
      some string with indent 2

It is possible to use any indent values but multiples of 4 are recommended (like [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).
